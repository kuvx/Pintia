He laid the foundation for the study of the Vaccean people with his work *The Vaccean Region: Celtiberianism and Romanization in the Middle Duero Basin*, which marked its 50th anniversary in 2009. To commemorate this, the CEVFW paid a heartfelt tribute and erected a commemorative monolith in his memory at the Pintian cemetery of Las Ruedas."
