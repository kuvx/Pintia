    "value": "The funerary stelae frequently appear here thermo-altered on the side in contact with the ground, which seems to indicate that they were knocked down while a fire was spreading through the area. This apparent destruction, a consequence of the Roman presence, must have occurred towards the end of the 2nd century or the beginning of the 1st century BC.

[
  {
    "type": "text",
    "value": "The ritual of exposure to vultures was reserved for warriors who died in combat, considered the noblest way to die within the Vaccaean ideology. The vulture was considered a sacred bird due to its ability to transfer, after swallowing the corpse, the soul of the deceased to the celestial realm.

[
  {
    "type": "text",
    "value": "Among the figurative elements, an enigmatic representation of a zoomorph in zenithal perspective that seems to lick a kneaded bread of small squares stands out. Some more explicit representations, such as the one shown on the shoulder of a grain storage container from the city of Rauda, leave no doubt about the animal species represented: the wolf. Such a form seems to have a beneficent or prophylactic meaning, but the non-literate nature of the Vaccaeans prevents us from unraveling the specific story behind this image."

[
  {
    "type": "text",
    "value": "This contemporary sculpture, half stone, half man, integrates into the landscape of stelae of Las Ruedas as if it had always been there. Its imperturbable gaze over the site and the acorn-pendant hanging from its neck may have the virtue of preventing sad episodes from the past of this cemetery, with thousands of clandestine holes made on its surface in search of antiquities to trade."

[
  {
    "type": "text",
    "value": "This funerary epigraph shows a highly virtuosic lapidary work in square capital letters, dated to the 1st-2nd centuries AD. Its conservation is precarious, having lost the third line due to a fire in the woodshed where it was kept. It was originally recovered in the area of the wineries of Padilla de Duero, suggesting its origin from this cemetery. The scarcity of Roman epigraphy in Vaccaean territory could indicate a low assimilation of this innovation introduced by Rome."

[
  {
    "type": "text",
    "value": "Among the most characteristic elements of the funerary landscape of Las Ruedas are limestone milestones brought from nearby hills such as Pajares. In 1994, several stelae carved with a trapezoidal base and discoid head were recovered. The reconstruction of the arch preserved in some of them reveals diameters greater than two meters, classifying them as 'giant stelae', similar to those known in Cantabrian or Asturian areas. The fact that this area of the site is known as 'Las Ruedas' (The Wheels) is believed to be due to the presence of these monumenta of Roman chronology with vernacular flavor."

The remains are placed in jars inside the structure's holes, inscribed in a mosaic of the zoomorph in zenithal perspective. The monument aims to create a Vaccaean memorial area where, especially every November 1st (date of the Celtic Samhain), homage can be paid to both recent deaths (sashas) and the ancient and forgotten Vaccaeans (zamanis)."

From here, one can see both the current cemetery to the south (sashas) and the ancient Vaccaean and Roman one to the north (zamanis). A sculpture by Felipe Rodríguez ('Pipe') with a cross and a triskelion symbolizes the duality of Christian and Celtic traditions. Unfortunately, one of the three plots of the ancient cemetery is still under agricultural use."

Engraved with characteristic elements of the Vaccaean world, it serves as a focal point for an area of cenotaph plaques.
