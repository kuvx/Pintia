From here, one can see both the current cemetery to the south (sashas) and the ancient Vaccean and Roman cemetery to the north (zamanis). A sculpture by Felipe Rodr√≠guez ('Pipe') featuring a cross and a triskele symbolizes the duality of Christian and Celtic traditions. Unfortunately, one of the three plots of the ancient cemetery is still under agricultural cultivation."
