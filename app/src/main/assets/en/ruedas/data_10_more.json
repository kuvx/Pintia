    "value": "The ritual of exposure to vultures was reserved for warriors killed in battle, considered the noblest way to die within the Vaccean ideology. The vulture was considered a sacred bird due to its ability to transport the soul of the deceased to the celestial realm after devouring the corpse. Evidence of this ritual has been found at Las Ruedas, including a bronze plaque with the head of a vulture and human bones that were crushed, not cremated."
