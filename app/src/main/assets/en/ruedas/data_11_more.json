Some more explicit representations, like the one shown on the shoulder of a grain storage vessel from the city of Rauda, leave no doubt about the depicted animal species: the wolf. This form appears to have a protective or prophylactic meaning, but the illiteracy of the Vacceans prevents us from unraveling the specific story behind this image."
