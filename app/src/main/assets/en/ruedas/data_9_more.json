    "value": "Some friends and collaborators of the Pintia Project, who sadly are no longer with us, have wished for their remains to rest in this sacred space. Their ashes, accompanied by commemorative plaques that honor them, along with a hawthorn and a yew, rest beneath the surface of this Vaccean-Roman cemetery, continuing its use in the 21st century with the same ritual that marked its birth two and a half thousand years ago."
