In 1994, several stelae were recovered with a trapezoidal base and a disc-shaped head. The reconstruction of the arch preserved in some of them reveals diameters over two meters, classifying them as 'giant stelae', similar to those found in Cantabrian or Asturian areas. These Roman-period stelae with local influence likely gave rise to the toponym 'Las Ruedas'."
