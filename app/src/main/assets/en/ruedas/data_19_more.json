In addition, a dry elm tree serves as a perch for various wind chimes, or tintinabula, designed similarly to those used by the Vacceans in children's tombs for protective purposes. Those wishing for such protection or simply wishing to make a wish can purchase these tintinabula at the Federico Wattenberg Vaccean Studies Center shop, or they may throw a coin into the nearby wishing well."
