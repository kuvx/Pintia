    "value": "This funerary inscription displays a highly virtuosic work in square capital letters, dated to the 1st-2nd centuries AD. Its preservation is precarious, having lost the third line due to a fire in the woodpile where it was kept. It was originally recovered in the Padilla de Duero cellars area, suggesting its origin from this cemetery. The scarcity of Roman epigraphy in the Vaccean territory could indicate low assimilation of this innovation introduced by Rome."
