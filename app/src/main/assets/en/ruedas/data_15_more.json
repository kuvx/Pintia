The remains are placed in jars within the structure's holes, inscribed with a mosaic of the zoomorphic in top-down perspective. The monument aims to create a Vaccean memory area where, especially every November 1st (date of the Celtic Samhain), both recent (sashas) and ancient, forgotten Vacceans (zamanis) can be honored."
