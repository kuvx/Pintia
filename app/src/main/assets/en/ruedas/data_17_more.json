Engraved with elements characteristic of the Vaccean world, it serves as a focal point for an area of cenotaph plaques. Here, residents of Padilla de Duero and friends of the site have left records of their deceased relatives, updating the traditional uses of a cemetery and creating a connection between the past and the present."
